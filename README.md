# DATS6403-Final project
International trade happens when goods and services are exchanged between countries. Trade counts as a major part of a countryâ€™s GDP, and international trade contributes to half of world economic activity, identifies new markets and helps countries gain access to goods and services that are unavailable in their domestic markets. This project uses visualizations to help describe the world trade flow between regions and countries.
